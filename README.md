#  ESP32 Search and Rescue Rover

An all-terrain, semi-autonomous **search and rescue rover** powered by the **ESP32 microcontroller**. Built to assist in post-disaster recovery missions, this rover streams **live video over Wi-Fi**, communicates sensor and control data via **LoRa**, and supports **autonomous navigation** and **remote operation**. It is designed to **identify hazardous areas** and **locate survivors** in dangerous environments without risking human lives.

##  Software & Development

- **Development Platform**: Arduino IDE
- **GUI**: Python desktop application for control and data display
- **Communication Strategy**:
  - Wi-Fi for real-time video
  - LoRa for long-range telemetry and command
- **Technical Challenge**: Managing various modules and handling multiple data streams using the **limited I/O pins of the ESP32** was a major challenge. We implemented efficient pin multiplexing and asynchronous communication techniques to make this possible.

## Purpose

This rover was built to:
- Assist **search and rescue teams** in locating individuals in disaster-affected areas.
- Detect **hazardous gases and unsafe conditions** before human entry.
- Share **real-time GPS coordinates** to guide emergency responders.
- Operate in **rough terrain** and high-heat zones.
